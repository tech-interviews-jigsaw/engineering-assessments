    "John has a cattle farm which consists of a few pens. Each pen houses some cows. The cows in each pen are of the same breed. Each breed of cow eats only one type of feed, yields a certain amount of milk, and generates a certain level of greenhouse gases.John has asked you to help him simulate his farm so he can foresee the consequences of his decisions. Develop a code based on OOP to simulate this cattle farm, and run a few scenarios to showcase how it works. Some example features of this simulation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pen allocation: What breed is allocated to this pen? How many cows are there?\n",
    "- Milk yield calculation: How much milk should we expect from each pen? Can you make a time series?\n",
    "- Greenhouse gas emissions: Overall, how much greenhouse gases does this scenario generate?\n",
    "- Cost estimation: Based on the type and amount of the consumed feeds, how much does it cost John to implement this scenario in his farm?"
