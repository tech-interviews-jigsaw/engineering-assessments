    "John has a cattle farm which consists of a few pens. Each pen houses some cows. The cows in each pen are of the same breed. Each breed of cow eats only one type of feed, yields a certain amount of milk, and generates a certain level of greenhouse gases.John has asked you to help him simulate his farm so he can foresee the consequences of his decisions. Develop a code based on OOP to simulate this cattle farm, and run a few scenarios to showcase how it works. Some example features of this simulation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pen allocation: What breed is allocated to this pen? How many cows are there?\n",
    "- Milk yield calculation: How much milk should we expect from each pen? Can you make a time series?\n",
    "- Greenhouse gas emissions: Overall, how much greenhouse gases does this scenario generate?\n",
    "- Cost estimation: Based on the type and amount of the consumed feeds, how much does it cost John to implement this scenario in his farm?"

But looking over the questions again, it looks like that's unnecessary -- there's no question that's related to this.  So it looks like we can stick with the simpler version and say a cow has one pen, and we'll assume that our cows stay put.  "
