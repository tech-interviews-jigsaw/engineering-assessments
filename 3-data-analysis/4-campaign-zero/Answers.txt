How many traffic stop-involved police killings (TSPKs) are there in total?

595

What proportion of all police killings do TSPKs comprise? Briefly describe how you arrived at these numbers and 
explain any decisions you made in the process.

17% / I divided the total number of police killing by the total TSPKS.

Which state has the highest per capita rate of TSPKs overall and what is it? Which state has the lowest per capita rate, and what is it? 
How do these numbers compare to the national per capita rate?

Do you have any concerns about the data used to generate the results in Parts 1-3? If so, what are they?

Data quality issues that may have occured during reporting.  I would also think that some municipalties may underreport 
incidents or try corrupt certain aspects of the data.

Write a script that re-computes the top 3 agencies and their TSPK counts, correcting for these data entry issues, and attach it with the rest of your code and answers.
Does making this correction change the answer in Part 2?

Yes, Georgia State Patrol is now responsible for the mosdt TSPK's.
